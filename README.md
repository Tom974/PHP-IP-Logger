# PHP IP Logger
The logger is based on PHP, connected to a database with PDO.
There is a dashboard where you can see all the ips entered, it basically saves you from going into the database with MySQL workbench.
# Why?
I have created this logger to learn myself coding standards, and learn a bit about PHP. Do not expect good and clean coding text.
