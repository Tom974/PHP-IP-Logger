# PHP Ip Logger
The logger is based on PHP, connected to a database with PDO.
# Panel
In the panel you can basically control the data that is in the database.
# Why?
I have created this logger to learn myself coding standards, and learn a bit about PHP.
# FAQ

``Why is there not a structure?``

I do in fact realise that the project is not organised, as I have stated down this was a small "project" for me to learn more about PHP.
